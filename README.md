## Introduction

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. This project employs deep learning techniques to build a sentiment analysis model capable of classifying text data.

## Project Overview

- **Data**: We used a dataset containing text data and corresponding sentiment labels. The data was preprocessed to prepare it for modeling.

- **Modeling**: Deep learning models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were implemented and trained on the data to perform sentiment classification.

- **Evaluation**: The models' performance was assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

- **Deployment**: The final trained model can be deployed for real-world sentiment analysis tasks.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `tweet_text`: The text of the tweet.
- `emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at`: Whether the emotion expressed in the tweet is directed at a brand or product (Positive emotion, Negative emotion, No emotion toward brand or product).
- `is_there_an_emotion_directed_at_a_brand_or_product`: Indicates if there is an emotion directed towards a brand or product in the tweet (Yes/No).

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any NLP project. Here are some of the preprocessing steps applied:

- Text cleaning: Removal of special characters, punctuation, and extra spaces.
- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- Padding: Ensuring that sequences have the same length for modeling.

## Modeling

We experimented with various deep-learning architectures, including RNNs and CNNs. These models were implemented using Keras, a high-level deep-learning library.

## Evaluation Metrics

We used the following evaluation metrics to assess model performance:

- Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: Provide insights into the model's performance for each sentiment class.
- Confusion Matrix: Breaks down true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

## Results

The model achieved the following results:

- Accuracy: 0.64
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Vary depending on the class and dataset distribution.
